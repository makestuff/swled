There's something wrong with how comm_fpga_ss is synthesized by the Lattice
tools. Firstly, writes don't work unless the reset_in branch of the first
process is commented out (despite the fact that it should be optimised out
anyway by the fact that top_level.vhdl clamps reset_in low). Secondly, for
reasons I don't have time to investigate, reads return zero and leave the link
in a bad state.
